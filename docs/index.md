Weekly tours on _[Numerical Optimization  - Jorge Nocedal & Stephen J. Wright](http://www.apmath.spbu.ru/cnsa/pdf/monograf/Numerical_Optimization2006.pdf)_

>_Note_ : I knew of [`cppoptlib`](https://github.com/PatWie/CppNumericalSolvers/tree/master/include/cppoptlib) way before I started this, but only after already committing to the Functor-Problem-Solver template model did I look at the codebase and realized that a lot of design choices are almost identical. Perhaps arose from the decision to use Eigen along with the standard view in optimization to first define the Functor, the Problem and then to figure out the Solver. Goal here however isn't to do things differently, but merely to learn and/or revise Numerical Optimization by doing. If you chance upon this repo, while looking for a numerical optimization library, `cppoptlib` is probably what you need.
